## Anime Pack

The Anime Pack is an ever-growing collection of anime-based themes, each with their own unique set of colors and backgrounds.

You can find these themes, obviously, in the AnimePack folder. A .zip version is also available.

## NightLife Family

The NightLife theme is an *extremely* heavily customized version of NotAnotherAnimeTheme that gives the Discord client
a heavily gradiented and highly aesthetic Neon look. This folder contains 3 themes. Defiant and Whistful are re-colored clones of
NightLife, with Whistful being a cotton-candy-flavored cheery theme, and Defiant having a darker aesthetic.

> *say goodbye to your CPU though*

## Other Themes

- AMOLED: A theme that skins the majority of the Discord client to be black
- Wubzy: A theme based off of my website: [wubzy.xyz](https://wubzy.xyz)
- Homework Girl/Lofi Christmas: Lofi girl gif-based themes
